# Sakura WP

Modular, dynamic WordPress theme based on a static HTML, CSS & Bootstrap template. Allows the user to publish, edit, view and remove posts and pages. Includes an archive, comments as well as a contact page.

The theme was designed by Andrew Wilson as part of his freeCodeCamp WP course.
